**Iris Flower Classification** ðŸŒ¸

**Overview**

This project classifies iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using machine learning. The dataset consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for classification.

**Dataset**

The dataset is sourced from the Iris dataset provided by Scikit-learn. It contains 150 samples with 50 samples per class.

**Technologies Used**

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)


**Results**

The trained SVM model achieves an accuracy of 95%+ on the test set.
